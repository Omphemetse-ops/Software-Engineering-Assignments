## Reviving Hailo: A Modern Take on a Legacy System
Welcome to my Software Engineering portfolio, where I embark on a journey to breathe new life into the Hailo taxi hailing system. Hailo, a pioneering taxi-hailing service, may have ceased operations over 15 years ago, but its legacy lives on. This repository showcases my comprehensive analysis, redesign, and implementation of the Hailo system using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Agile methodology. Through meticulous documentation and modern techniques, I aim to present a robust and scalable solution ready for todayâ€™s technological landscape.

1. Overview
2. Assignment 1: Software Requirements Specification
3. Assignment 2: Design and Implementation

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find two key assignments that showcase the transformation of the Hailo system from its legacy form to a modern, efficient, and user-friendly application. Each assignment builds upon the last, providing a comprehensive view of the software engineering process from requirements gathering to implementation.

## Assignment 1: Software Requirements Specification

### Folder 1: Report Documents
This section delves into the foundation of the Hailo system, starting with its historical context and moving towards a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS). The goal is to understand the original system thoroughly and then redefine its requirements to meet modern standards.

#### Historical Context:
- Exploration of the original Hailo system, its features, and limitations.
- Analysis of the market needs and technological environment of its time.

#### User Characteristics:
- Identification of user personas, including drivers, passengers, and administrators.
- Detailed analysis of user needs, behaviors, and interaction patterns.

#### Functional Requirements:
- Comprehensive list of functionalities the system must offer.
- Use Case Diagram illustrating the interactions between users and the system.

#### Traceability Matrix:
Mapping of requirements to subsystems to ensure all needs are addressed.

#### UML Class Diagram:
Visual representation of the system's structure, showing classes, attributes, and relationships.

#### Non-Functional (Quality) Requirements:
Specification of performance, security, usability, and other quality attributes.

Explore the Software Requirements Specification to understand the groundwork of the revamped Hailo system.

## Assignment 2: Design and Implementation
### Folder 1: Report Documents
### Folder 2: Design Diagrams

Building upon the specifications from Assignment 1, this section focuses on the design and implementation of the new Hailo system. Here, you will find detailed architectural plans and practical implementation strategies.

### Quantification of Quality Requirements:
Metrics and benchmarks to measure the fulfillment of quality attributes.

### Architectural Design:
- Architectural Patterns: Explanation of patterns used, such as MVC, Microservices, etc.
- Architectural Styles (Tactics): Discussion on styles and tactics applied to achieve desired quality attributes.
- Architectural Constraints: Constraints considered during the design process.

### Actor-System Interaction Models:
- Detailed diagrams and descriptions of how users and system components interact.

### Deployment Model:
Overview of the deployment strategy, including cloud services, servers, and network configurations.

### Technology Requirements (Technical):
Specification of the technical stack, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, and third-party services.

Explore the Design and Implementation section to see the transformation from theory to practice.


## Assignment 3: System Implementation and Features
### Folder 3: Implemented System
This section showcases the actual implementation of the system, featuring separate modules for drivers, customers, and data analytics with machine learning for data scientists. The focus is on delivering a comprehensive, functional system with advanced data analytics capabilities.

### Driver System:
Features designed for drivers, including ride requests, navigation, and earnings tracking.

### Customer System:
Features for customers, such as ride booking, payment processing, and ride history.

### Data Analytics and Machine Learning:
Tools and dashboards for data scientists to analyze ride data, predict demand, and optimize operations.

### System Screenshots:
Visual screenshots of the implemented system, showcasing the user interface and key features.

### System Videos:
Video demonstrations of the system in action, providing a comprehensive overview of the user experience and system functionalities.

Explore the System Implementation and Features to see the final product and its capabilities.
