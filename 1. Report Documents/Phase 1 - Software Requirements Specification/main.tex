\section*{1. Introduction}
%\subsection*{1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION}
\subsubsection*{1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION}
Hailo was a British tech-taxi hailing business\cite{intro}\cite{pessok} that connected taxi drivers and customers(passengers) through an Android and iOS mobile app\cite{mobile}, providing safe and convenient transportation\cite{app}. Founded in late 2010, it debuted in London in 2011 and then moved to North America\cite{citekey} by the end of 2012. The software enabled real-time tracking, secure payment processes, and wheelchair-accessible features.
\\\\
Hailo began as a taxi booking service that brought together customers with drivers in urban areas. However, by the end of 2014, it had ceased operations in North America due to heavy competition and a failure to create a strong relationship with New York taxi drivers. Other competitors, like Uber, dominated in more expensive cities and towns, while Hailo was unable to adjust to the market, eventually leading to its collapse. 
\\\\Hailo revolutionized\cite{riches} transportation by providing real-time tracking, safe payment methods, and wheelchair accessibility\cite{intro}. The Hailo mobile application was popular in the transportation industry, notably among taxi drivers who supplied transportation to consumers.

\subsection*{1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT}
During its existence, the Hailo app encountered challenges including competition from other transportation companies, difficulty adapting to national market needs and regulations, and dealing with legal issues such as lawsuits. These difficulties restricted the mobile application's expansion and durability in the sector of transportation, emphasising the importance of innovation, careful planning, and adherence to legislation for market success.
\subsection*{1.3 DEFINITION OF SCOPE}
This project aims to improve the Hailo app by adding features such as a cloud database, machine learning, geolocation services, social media platforms, and in-app messaging. Cloud databases and machine learning will make it possible for continuous updates, data analysis for performance monitoring, and recommendations on where to focus and what to improve in order to advance further in the market. Social media will be used for marketing and advertising the application and the geolocation services that enable precise pick-up and drop-off locations, real-time traffic information for informed decision-making, and messaging within the app for customer-driver contact.
\section*{2. USER CHARACTERISTICS}
The intended users for the Hailo app are diversified, including customers, drivers, administrators, data scientists(analytics):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Customers:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Education}: Customers are assumed to have smartphone expertise and technical skills because the mobile application is designed to be simple to use and accessible to a wide range of users. The customer would use the system to request services (rides), follow driver locations, and make payments.
        \item \textbf{Age}: Customers must be at least 12 years old, unless a parent requests services on their behalf. In such circumstances, the parent should show their registered ID to the driver.
        \item \textbf{Physicality}: The Hailo app should be designed to be accessible and user-friendly for all, including people with disabilities. This includes wheelchair options, audio descriptions, adaptable text sizes, and voice command capabilities, which ensure that every customer can travel simply, communicate with drivers, and navigate their journeys. Prioritising inclusion in app design can help build a more accessible transport service for individuals with disabilities.
        \item \textbf{Gender}: Any gender can request services.
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Drivers:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Education}: Drivers must have an educational foundation that includes knowledge of geography and basic finance, as well as a basic understanding of mobile devices and navigation systems.
        \item \textbf{Experience}: Drivers should have at least three years of driving experience, as they will be using the system to handle trip requests, find pick-up and drop-off locations, manage their schedules, and track payments, particularly cash.
        \item \textbf{Age}: expected should be above 18 and below 60. 
        \item \textbf{Physicality}: The Hailo app should provide accessibility features such as voice commands, larger text sizes, and colour contrast adjustments to ensure that all drivers, regardless of impairment, can efficiently use the platform for tasks such as service requests, navigation, and calendar management.
        \item \textbf{Gender}: Any gender can request services.
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Admin:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Education}: Administrators are expected to have higher technical expertise, as they would use technological tools to administer accounts for users and monitor system operations. To increase efficiency, monitor performance data and apply updates and enhancements.
        \item \textbf{Age}: should be below 65.
        \item \textbf{Physicality}: Admin with disability are allowed to apply.
        \item \textbf{Gender}: Both Male and Females are allowed.
    \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Data Scientists/Analytics:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Education}: Degrees in data science, analytics, or similar fields are among the educational prerequisites.
        \item \textbf{Experience or expertise:} Proficiency in data visualisation, machine learning, and database management are among the expertise sets required to analyse large amounts of data, identify trends, develop demand forecasting models, and increase productivity in the on-demand transportation industry, promoting innovation and business growth.
        \item \textbf{Age}: should be below 65 years.
        \item \textbf{Gender}: Any gender can request services.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{ |p{4cm}|p{12cm}| }
 \hline
 \rowcolor{lightgray} \textbf{PIECES CATEGORIES (REQUIREMENTS)} & \textbf{DESCRIPTION}\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR1.Performance}   & The application should respond quickly to administrative activities. When connecting with the database through APIs for payments, sign-ups, sign-ins, or password recovery, the application should listen and respond quickly.\\
  \hline
 \textbf{CR2.Security} &   Validations should occur during sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery. Sensitive data should be preserved and encrypted before being saved to a database or other data repository. There should be access controls in place, as well as regular security audits. When unknown situations occur, the system should be capable of responding promptly. \\
  \hline
 \textbf{CR3.Scalability} & The programme should be capable of handling vast quantities of data going through databases, listening to data from the database, updating data, and accommodating an increasing number of users, service requests, and accepting service requests.\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR4.Reliability} &The system should be reliable and stable, with minimal downtime and no data loss. The system should shut down less frequently, and services should always be available at any time. There should be limited delays when requesting services and no incorrect payments.\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR5.Compatibility}&   The programme should be compatible with a variety of mobile operating systems, particularly for IOS and Android.\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR6.Compliance}& To ensure data protection, the system ought to adhere to the legislation of the country (location) where the services are provided, as well as data privacy regulations.\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR7.User Interface}& The system should be user-friendly and simple to use, with typefaces that may be modified for better reading. The system should be simple to use, available across several devices, and include audio.
\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR8.Error Handling}& The system should have the capacity to handle unexpected errors and record them so that maintainers can locate where the error occurred while minimising hours of downtime.
\\
 \hline
 \textbf{CR9.Maintainability}& The code should be fully documented and written to allow adaptation to subsequent updates and errors, as well as easy navigation. There should be system documentation that serves as a roadmap for changes and maintenance.
\\
